# Welcome to this notebook!

This notebook was created by [me](https://twitter.com/Katrien_Vandb) in just a couple of minutes!

Jupyter Notebook supports [hyperlinks](https://jupyter.org/), allows you to structure your content (you can even link to other [pages!](.\notebooks.ipynb)) and makes it easier to explain concepts ; Not only in Python (which is the default coding format) but also in [R](https://datatofish.com/r-jupyter-notebook/#:~:text=%20Steps%20to%20Add%20R%20to%20Jupyter%20Notebook,run%20your%20desired%20R%20code.%20%20More%20), [Matlab](http://www.jmlilly.net/jupyter-matlab) and many more! 

It is easy to implement, allows clear and interactive communication and it even starts to be used in [scientific papers](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)! (*You can also have a look at this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/1455901250055118856)!*)

If you want to have a look at other (neuroimaging-related) notebooks supported by Jupyter, have a look at these:

-   <https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html>
-   <https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

I have started using it only recently, and currently am creating a notebook to explain Machine Learning concepts to myself to share later on with others (you can check out the pilot version [here](https://katrivdn.github.io/MVPA_tutorial/intro.html) - **I would btw. be more than happy if you want to help me improve the tutorial !**). If you are interested in getting to work with it yourself, e-mail me at: <Katrien80.vdb@gmail.com> If enough people want to join, I will organize a small workshop :) (you will see: it\'s *really reeallly* easy!)
